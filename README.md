# Persenk-Ultra

To quote the [official website](http://persenk-ultra.com):

>"Persenk Ultra is a mountain foot race with a high degree of difficulty, with a great elevation gain (5387 m), variety of weather conditions (night and day) and long distance (132 km), which challenges participantsâ€™ endurance and requires excellent physical and mental preparation, proper equipment and strong-willed spirit."

The goal of this project is to create a web service that allows supporters and fans to track the runners' progress (at what time do they leave each aid station/checkpoint) and for the aid station volunteers to easily upload the times of arrival.

The backend of the project is written in Java and running on Apache Tomcat. It provides a RESTful API that allows easy interfacing with different platforms. The web frontend uses Bootstrap and jQuery. An Android mobile application is considered, but not yet planned seriously. For more technical details, please check out the wiki.
